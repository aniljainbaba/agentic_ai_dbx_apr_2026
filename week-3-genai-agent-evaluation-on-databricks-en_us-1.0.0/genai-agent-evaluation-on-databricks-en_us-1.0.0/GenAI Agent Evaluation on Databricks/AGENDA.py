# MAGIC ## GenAI Agent Evaluation on Databricks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This course teaches students how to systematically evaluate AI agents using MLflow's evaluation framework, addressing the unique challenges of non-deterministic AI systems that traditional software testing cannot handle. Students learn to implement various evaluation approaches including built-in judges for common criteria like correctness and safety, guideline judges for business-specific requirements, and custom judges for specialized needs. The course covers both offline evaluation using curated datasets and online production monitoring, with hands-on experience using MLflow's tracing capabilities to understand agent execution patterns and collect human feedback from different stakeholder types. Through practical demonstrations and labs, students develop skills in creating evaluation workflows that drive continuous quality improvements throughout the AI agent development lifecycle.

# MAGIC ## Requirements
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Please review the following requirements before starting the lesson:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * To run demo and lab notebooks, you need to use **Serverless compute (version 5)**, which is enabled by default.
# MAGIC * This course requires access to MLflow's evaluation framework and Unity Catalog for agent registration and governance.
# MAGIC * Some demonstrations require model serving endpoints for agent deployment and evaluation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The course is structured into three logical modules:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC 1. **Module 1** introduces the fundamental challenges of AI agent evaluation and MLflow's framework
# MAGIC 2. **Module 2** covers the core evaluation approaches using built-in and guideline judges
# MAGIC 3. **Module 3** explores advanced topics including custom judges, human feedback, and evaluation strategies
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Each module combines lectures for conceptual understanding with hands-on demos and labs for practical implementation. The progression moves from basic concepts to advanced techniques, ensuring students build a comprehensive understanding of AI agent evaluation using MLflow on Databricks.
